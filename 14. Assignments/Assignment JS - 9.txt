Assignment 9: Given an object obj, we have to invert its key and value for each entry. Inversion will result in value being used as key and key as value.


E.g:

Input:  let obj = { name: "Prakash", age: 111, hairColor: "black", likes: "food" };

Output: { '111': 'age', Prakash: 'name', black: 'hairColor', food: 'likes' }
